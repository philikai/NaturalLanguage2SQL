# Fine-Tuning CodeLLama for NL2SQL

## Overview

This repository contains resources and guides from the blog series "Natural Language to SQL: Fine-Tuning CodeLLama with Amazon SageMaker". The first part introduces the concept of NL2SQL, the role of large language models (LLMs) like CodeLLama in this domain, and practical strategies for fine-tuning these models using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on Amazon SageMaker.

## Contents

- **Part 1**: provides a comprehensive guide on setting up the development environment, loading and preparing the dataset, the fine-tuning process of CodeLLama using QLoRA, and deployment strategies on Amazon SageMaker.

  1. Setting up the development environment
  2. Loading and preparing the dataset
  3. Fine-tuning process
  4. Deployment strategies

- **Part 2 & 3**: (Upcoming) Further exploration and advanced topics in fine-tuning and deployment.
